# Advent-of-Code

Repo of my Advent of Code Programs.

Programs are designed to be run using `runDay.py`. For example, to run 2021's Day 20 Part 1, use `./runDay.py 2021 20 1`.

I solve each day by bodging together something that works, then I clean my code up before I commit it here. Because someone might one day look at this code (probably me) and I don't want to fry their brains.

## Dependencies

Python 3.10 - some solutions use brand-new features. I decided to make my output a bit fancy, so you must have `termcolor` installed: `pip3 install termcolor`.
